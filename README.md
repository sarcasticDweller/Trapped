# Foreword
This is a project that I originally pushed to Github on Febraury 6, 2019. *Six years later*, I started refactoring it to turn it into an actual game. The initial commit of this repo unfortunately does not work. However, the second commit does work and is playable. It's worth going back and looking at that version.
