# Foreword
This is a project that I originally pushed to Github on Febraury 6, 2019. *Six years later*, I started refactoring it to turn it into an actual game. It's still a heavy work in progress and some features may not be entirely clear.


# About
Navigate the looney bin and get the loon before it gets you! Try to keep your head straight while navigating in two dimensions through linear space.

# How to Play
Entirely built in Python. Just run main.py to play!
Controls are *meant* to be arrow keys, but instead arrow inputs are simulated with the number keys. Press 1 and 3 to cycle left and right through the menu. Press 2 to select an option. After pressing a number key you **must** press enter to send your input to the game.
